# Introduction
Desmos API is a Blockchain Connector solution developed by IN2.
As a Blockchain Connector, it is a crucial part within the Access Node architecture
facilitating interaction between the Off-Chain Storage and the On-Chain Storage. 
This RESTFul API exposes a set of endpoints designed for seamless communication between a Context Broker and a Blockchain Adapter.


# Installation

We offer a Docker image to run the application. You can find it in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/in2kizuna/desmos/general).

Here, you can find the docker-compose.yml file to run the application with all the required dependencies (Context Broker and Blockchain Adapter).

## Running the application (the easy way)
```bash
cd config/docker
docker-compose up -d
```
